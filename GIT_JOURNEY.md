## Conflicts Resolved

### Merge 1: main + dev (6 files)

#### Conflict 1: config/app-config.yaml
- **Issue**: Production used port 8080, development used 3000
- **Resolution**: Created unified config with environment-based settings
- **Strategy**: Keep production as default, add dev as optional
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 15 minutes

#### Conflict 2: config/database-config.json
- **Issue**: Different database hosts and SSL modes
- **Resolution**: Created separate profiles for production and development
- **Strategy**: Restructured JSON to support both environments
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 10 minutes

#### Conflict 3: scripts/deploy.sh
- **Issue**: Different deployment strategies (production vs docker-compose)
- **Resolution**: Added conditional logic based on DEPLOY_ENV variable
- **Strategy**: Made script handle both environments dynamically
- **Difficulty**: Hard
- **Time**: 20 minutes

#### Conflict 4: scripts/monitor.js
- **Issue**: Different monitoring intervals and log formats
- **Resolution**: Environment-based configuration object
- **Strategy**: Used process.env.NODE_ENV to determine behavior
- **Difficulty**: Medium
- **Time**: 15 minutes

#### Conflict 5: docs/architecture.md
- **Issue**: Different architectural descriptions
- **Resolution**: Merged both descriptions into comprehensive document
- **Strategy**: Created sections for each environment
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 10 minutes

#### Conflict 6: README.md
- **Issue**: Different feature lists and version numbers
- **Resolution**: Combined all features with clear environment labels
- **Strategy**: Organized features by category
- **Difficulty**: Easy
- **Time**: 10 minutes

### Merge 2: main + conflict-simulator (6 files)

Conflict 1: config/app-config.yaml

Issue: conflict-simulator branch introduced experimental configuration and feature flags, while main retained stable environment defaults.
Resolution: Unified both by keeping stable configs as default and adding experimental settings behind FEATURE_EXPERIMENTAL flag.
Strategy: Used conditional environment block structure to toggle experimental behavior.
Difficulty: Medium
Time: 15 minutes

Conflict 2: config/database-config.json

Issue: main used standard database settings, while conflict-simulator added a new “experimental” profile and credentials format.
Resolution: Integrated the experimental profile under a new profiles.experimental section while keeping production and development unchanged.
Strategy: Enabled profile switching using an environment variable DB_PROFILE.
Difficulty: Medium
Time: 15 minutes

Conflict 3: scripts/deploy.sh

Issue: conflict-simulator introduced an experimental deployment path with mock simulation logic; main used a direct production deploy flow.
Resolution: Combined both by adding a conditional --simulate flag to trigger experimental deployment.
Strategy: Modularized deployment functions and used environment checks to switch between simulation and production.
Difficulty: Hard
Time: 20 minutes

Conflict 4: scripts/monitor.js

Issue: conflict-simulator integrated AI-enhanced monitoring metrics, while main had basic log-based monitoring.
Resolution: Merged both by keeping standard monitoring and adding optional AI insights module.
Strategy: Added configuration toggle USE_AI_MONITOR=true to enable advanced monitoring.
Difficulty: Medium
Time: 15 minutes

Conflict 5: docs/architecture.md

Issue: conflict-simulator branch documented experimental architecture flow; main had standard system overview.
Resolution: Merged both by adding a dedicated “Experimental Architecture Overview” subsection.
Strategy: Retained stable architecture as main section and appended simulation diagrams as an appendix.
Difficulty: Easy
Time: 10 minutes

Conflict 6: README.md

Issue: conflict-simulator added experimental build and usage details; main contained standard release info.
Resolution: Combined both with a clear “Experimental Mode” section under the Features list.
Strategy: Organized by environment (Stable / Experimental) and noted version compatibility.
Difficulty: Easy
Time: 10 minutes

## Most Challenging Parts

1. **Understanding Conflict Markers**: Initially confused by `<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>` symbols. Learned that HEAD is current branch and the other side is incoming changes.

2. **Deciding What to Keep**: Hardest part was choosing between conflicting code. Learned to read both versions completely before deciding.

3. **Complex Logic Conflicts**: deploy.sh had completely different logic. Had to understand both approaches before combining.

4. **Testing After Resolution**: Making sure resolved code actually worked was crucial.

## Key Learnings

### Technical Skills
- Mastered conflict resolution process
- Understood merge conflict markers
- Learned to use git diff effectively
- Practiced all major Git commands

### Best Practices
- Always read both sides of conflict before resolving
- Test resolved code before committing
- Write detailed merge commit messages
- Use git status frequently
- Commit atomically

### Git Workflow Insights
- Conflicts are normal, not errors
- Take time to understand both changes
- When in doubt, ask for clarification
- Document your resolution strategy
- Keep calm and read carefully

## Reflection
This challenge taught me that merge conflicts aren't scary - they're 
just Git asking "which version do you want?". The key is understanding 
what each side is trying to do before combining them. I now feel 
confident handling conflicts in real projects.

The hands-on practice with all Git commands (especially rebase and 
cherry-pick) was invaluable. I understand the difference between merge 
and rebase, and when to use each. Most importantly, I learned that 
git reflog is a lifesaver!
